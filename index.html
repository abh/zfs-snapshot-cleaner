      ZFS Snapshot Cleanup
    </div>

    
      <p>zfs-snapshot-cleaner purges old ZFS snapshots in an intelligent (and careful) manner.</p>
      <h2>Features</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Doesn't rely on the backup running on certain days (first
        of the month, sunday, ...) to keep the right number of
        backups</li>

        <li>Independently calculates the number of
        hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly snapshots to keep.</li>

        <li>Handles various date formats.</li>

        <li>Make a snapshot permanent by adding a text description
        after the date (TODO: test this)</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Dependencies</h2>
      <p>Perl and the DateTime and IPC::Cmd modules.  Tested on FreeBSD, but 
        should also work on Solaris, SmartOS, OpenIndiana etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Perl modules are most easily installed with `cpanm`.
      </p>

      <pre>
        mkdir -p ~/bin
        curl --compressed -L -o ~/bin/cpanm http://xrl.us/cpanm
        chmod a+x ~/bin/cpanm
        ~/bin/cpanm DateTime IPC::Cmd
      </pre>

      <h2>Usage</h2>

      <p>
        For now look in the script for the options, the most important
        one is "-n" that makes the script not actually execute the zfs
        destroy commands. Use that while testing.
      </p>  

      <pre>
       ./zfs-snapshot-cleaner -n [file-system] [file-system]
      </pre>

      <h2>Other similar programs</h2>

      <p>
        Unsurprisingly there are about a gazillion other similar
        programs to this.  I chose to write another because the ones I
        found were either "too integrated" (as in wanting to also
        manage doing the snapshots, I make snapshots from my backup
        script) and/or too simple and written in bash so too error
        prone (for me) to extend.  You might like them better though!
      </p>  
        
        <p>The closest in spirit and functionality
        is <a href="https://github.com/knu/zfs-snapshot-clean">zfs-snapshot-clean</a>. If
        date parsing and handling wasn't such a pain in bash I'd have
        extended this script to be more flexible with regards to the
        particular day and date snapshots have to be made instead of
        writing a new program.
        </p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/graudeejs/zfSnap">zfSnap</a>
        prefers to do the snapshots, too. Has a clever (too clever?)
        option of putting the longevity of each snapshot into the
        snapshot name.
        </p>

        <p>There's also <a href="http://github.com/marius/zsnap">zsnap</a>
        (formerly zfs-snapshot-mgmt). It's supposed to run regularly
        in cron and have a yaml configuration file for when to make
        snapshots (and purge them, I think). Last update as of this
        writing was a change of maintainer a few year ago.</p>

        <p>
          Ralf
          S. Engelschall <a href="http://people.freebsd.org/~rse/snapshot/">made
          snapshot tools</a> that work with both UFS and ZFS
          filesystems on FreeBSD.  That seems to be the main
          feature. Again it really wants to also make the snapshots, seems best
          for snapshotting locally used file systems (vs backups of other computers)
          and is implemented as a sh script.
        </p>
